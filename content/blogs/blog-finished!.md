# I think my blog is finished. 

It only took me a few days to make a fully functioning blog with HUGO.

{{< figure src="/images/smiley face.png" width="200rem" alt="smiley face" >}}

### I even have code support with syntax highlighting !

{{< HighlightJS language="javascript" >}}const articles = [
  {
    name: 'cool',
    description: 'nice'
  },
  {
    name: 'cool 2',
    description: 'nice 2'
  },
  {
    name: 'cool 3',
    description: 'nice 3'
  },
  {
    name: 'cool 4',
    description: 'nice 4'
  },
  {
    name: 'cool 5',
    description: 'nice 5'
  },
  {
    name: 'cool 6',
    description: 'nice 6'
  }
]

articles.forEach(console.log){{< /HighlightJS >}}
