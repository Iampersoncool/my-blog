# I think my blog is finished. 

It only took me a few days to make a fully functioning blog with HUGO.

### I even have code support with syntax highlighting !

{{< highlight JavaScript >}}
  // code support

  function sayStuff() {
    console.log('hello world')
  }

  sayStuff()
{{< /highlight >}}
